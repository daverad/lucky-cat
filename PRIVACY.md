# Lucky Cat Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 2024**

## Overview

Lucky Cat is a Chrome extension that enhances the RevenueCat dashboard with revenue forecasting and optional Apple Search Ads ROI tracking. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

### What We Access

1. **RevenueCat Dashboard Data**
   - We read revenue figures displayed on RevenueCat's charts page
   - We read keyword attribution data from RevenueCat's attribution tables
   - This data is used only for local calculations and display

2. **Apple Search Ads Data (Optional)**
   - If you configure ASA integration, we access your ASA keyword spend data
   - This requires you to provide your ASA API credentials
   - We only request the minimum data needed (keyword-level spend)

### What We Store

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs:

- **Settings**: Your preferences for the extension
- **ASA Credentials**: If configured, your Apple Search Ads API credentials
- **Cached Data**: Temporary forecast calculations (configurable cache duration)

### What We DO NOT Collect

- We do NOT send any data to external servers (except Apple's ASA API if you enable that feature)
- We do NOT collect analytics or usage data
- We do NOT track your browsing activity
- We do NOT share any data with third parties
- We do NOT sell any data

## Data Security

- All credentials are stored locally in Chrome's encrypted storage
- No credentials or revenue data are ever transmitted to our servers (we have none)
- ASA API calls go directly from your browser to Apple's servers

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service this extension connects to is:

- **Apple Search Ads API** (optional, only if you configure ASA integration)
  - This connection is made directly from your browser to Apple's servers
  - Used only to fetch your keyword spend data
  - Governed by Apple's privacy policy

## Your Rights

- You can disable the extension at any time
- You can clear all stored data via the extension settings
- You can uninstall the extension to remove all local data
- You can revoke ASA credentials at any time in settings

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above.
